This subdirectory gives the best solution found in our study for 350 instances with 51 <= N <= 400. 
The best solution found is stored in a text file named "N_Sol.txt", where N is the number of unit circles. 
The format of solution file is as follows: 
The first line contains the number of unit circles (N) and the size of square container (L). 
As for the remaining parts, each line contains the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the center of one unit circle.
