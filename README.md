The software and data in this repository are a snapshot of the software and data
that were used in the research reported in the paper _Perturbation-based thresholding search for packing equal circles and spheres_ by L.J Lai, J.K. Hao, R.B. Xiao, and F. Glover. 

This repository includes mainly the following materials: 
- _source codes of proposed PBTS algorithm respectively for the PECS and PESC problems_ (See [source code](src/source_code) directory for the details.)
- _executable codes of proposed PBTS algorithm respectively for the PECS and PESC problems_ (See [executable code](src/executable_code) directory for the details.)
- _check procedure aiming to certify the feasibility of best solutions found_ (See [check procedure](src/check_procedure) directory for the details.)
- _Matlab procedure to show the configuration of solutions of the PECS problem_ (See [Matlab procedure](src/matlab procedure for pictures) directory for the details.)
- _detailed computatioanl results obtained in our experiments_(See [detailed results](results/detailed results) directory for the details.)
- _Best solutions found in the experiments_(See [best solutions](results/best solutions) directory for the details.)
